## Installation

### Composer

Add Laravel Localization to your `composer.json` file.

    "mcamara/laravel-localization": "dev-master"

Run `composer install` to get the latest version of the package.

### Manually

It's recommended that you use Composer, however you can download and install from this repository.

### Laravel 4

Laravel Localization comes with a service provider for Laravel 4. You'll need to add it to your `composer.json` as mentioned in the above steps, then register the service provider with your application.

Open `app/config/app.php` and find the `providers` key. Add `LaravelLocalizationServiceProvider` to the array.

```php
	...
	'Mcamara\LaravelLocalization\LaravelLocalizationServiceProvider'
	...
```

You can also add an alias to the list of class aliases in the same app.php

```php
	...
	'LaravelLocalization'	=> 'Mcamara\LaravelLocalization\Facades\LaravelLocalization'
	...
```

To finish, publish the configuration file using the command `php artisan config:publish mcamara/laravel-localization` in your laravel root path. This will create the following file `app/config/packages/mcamara/laravel-localization/config.php`, containing the most common setting options.

## Usage

Laravel Localization uses the URL given for the request. In order to achieve this purpose, a group should be added into the routes.php file. It will filter all pages that must be localized.

```php
	// app/routes.php

	Route::group(array('prefix' => LaravelLocalization::setLanguage()), function()
	{
		/** ADD ALL LOCALIZED ROUTES INSIDE THIS GROUP **/
		Route::get('/', function()
		{
			return View::make('hello');
		});

		Route::get('test',function(){
			return View::make('test');
		});
	});

	/** OTHER PAGES THAT SHOULD NOT BE LOCALIZED **/

```

Once this group is added to the routes file, a user can access all languages added into the 'languagesAllowed' ('en' and 'es' by default, look at the config section to change that option). For example, a user can now access to two different languages, using the following addresses:

```
	http://url-to-laravel/en
	http://url-to-laravel/es
	http://url-to-laravel
```

If the language is not present in the url or it is not defined in the 'languagesAllowed' array, the system will take the application default language (by default) or the user's browser default language (if defined in config file).

Once the language is defined, the language variable will be stored in a session, so it is not necessary to write the /lang/ section in the url after defining it once, using the last known language for the user. If the user accesses to a different language this session value would be changed, translating any other page he visits with the last chosen language.

Templates files and all language files should follow the [Lang class](http://laravel.com/docs/localization).

### Filters

Moreover, this package includes a filter to redirect all "non-languaged" routes to a "languaged" one (thanks to Sangar82).

So, if a user accesses to http://url-to-laravel/test and the system have this filter actived and 'en' as a current language for this user, it would redirect (301) him automatically to http://url-to-laravel/en/test. This is mainly used to avoid duplicate content and improve SEO performance.


```php
	// app/routes.php

	Route::group(
	array(
		'prefix' => LaravelLocalization::setLanguage(),
		'before' => 'LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter' // LaravelLocalization filter
	),
	function()
	{
		/** ADD ALL LOCALIZED ROUTES INSIDE THIS GROUP **/
		Route::get('/', function()
		{
			return View::make('hello');
		});

		Route::get('test',function(){
			return View::make('test');
		});
	});

	/** OTHER PAGES THAT SHOULD NOT BE LOCALIZED **/

```
In order to active it, you just have to attach this filter to the routes you want to be accessible localized.

If you want to hide the default language but always show other languages in the url, switch the 'hideDefaultLanguageInRoute' config value to true. Once it's true, if the default language is english all url containing /en/ would be redirected to the same url without this fragment but mantaining the language (all the website will be in english).

## Helpers

This package comes with some useful functions, like:

### Get Language Bar

```php
	/**
     * Returns html with language selector
     *
     * @param  boolean $abbr 		Should languages be abbreviate (2 characters) or full named?
     * @param  string $customView 	Which template should the language bar have?
     *
     * @return string 				Returns an html view with a language bar
     */
    public function getLanguageBar($abbr = false, $customView = 'mcamara/laravel-localization/languagebar')

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getLanguageBar(optional boolean $abbr, optional string $customView) }}
```

It returns an html string with `<a>` links to the very same page into another allowed language. Having english, catalan and spanish allowed as languages, being in url-to-laravel/test and english as the current language, this function would return...

```html
	<ul class="laravel_language_chooser">
		<li class="active">EN</li>
		<li><a rel="alternate" hreflang="ca" href="http://url-to-laravel/ca/test">CA</a></li>
		<li><a rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="http://url-to-laravel/es/test">ES</a></li>
	</ul>
```

If you are using translation routes, be sure that all keys exist for all languages. Otherwise, the language bar would not show the untranslated routes but it would show all the other links.

You can also define which view you want to use to show the language bar. If you want to create your own language bar from the example given in the package, you should publish it using the command `php artisan view:publish mcamara/laravel-localization`, it would create a language bar template (take a look at view section). If you rename the view, you should pass the new name as the $customView variable when the languageBar function is called, this function will look at this custom view within the app/view folder. In case this file does not exist, the language bar function would show the default bar.

### Get Clean routes

```php
	/**
     * It returns an URL without language (if it has it)
     *
     * @param  string $route URL to clean, if false, current url would be taken
     *
     * @return string        Route with no language path
     */
    public function getCleanRoute($route = null)

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getCleanRoute(optional string $route) }}
```

It returns a string, giving url passed through the function clean of any language section.

### Get URL for an specific language

```php
    /**
     * Returns an URL adapted to $language language
     *
     * @param  string $language Language to adapt
     * @param  string $route    URL to adapt, if false, current url would be taken
     *
     * @return string           URL translated
     */
    public function getURLLanguage($language, $route = null)

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getURLLanguage(string $lang, optional string $route) }}
```

It returns a string, translated to the desired language. If you pass a route to the function it has to be written in the current language, otherwise the function won't return the desired result.

### Get URL for an specific translation key

```php
	/**
     * Returns an URL adapted to the route name and the language given
     *
     * @param  string $language 		Language to adapt
     * @param  string $transKeyName  	Translation key name of the url to adapt
     * @param  array $attributes  		Attributes for the route (only needed if transKeyName needs them)
     *
     * @return string 	             	URL translated
     */
    public function getURLFromRouteNameTranslated($language, $transKeyName = null, $attributes = array())

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getURLFromRouteNameTranslated(string $lang, optional string $transKeyName, optional array $attributes) }}
```

It returns a string, translated to the desired language using the translation key given. If the translation key does not exist in the language given, this function will return false.

### Get Allowed Languages

```php
	/**
     * Returns all allowed languages
     *
     * @param  boolean $abbr should the languages be abbreviated?
     *
     * @return array Array with all allowed languages
     */
    public function getAllowedLanguages($abbr = true)

	//Should be called like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getAllowedLanguages(optional boolean $abbr) }}
```

It returns an array, each position contains an allowed language.

### Set Language

```php
	/**
     * Set and return current language
     *
     * @param  string $locale	Language to set the App to (optional)
     *
     * @return string 			Returns language (if route has any) or null (if route has not a language)
     */
    public function setLanguage($locale = null)

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::setLanguage(optional string $lang) }}
```

This function will change the application current language, if the language is not passed through its call, it would take the language from the session (if stored previously), browser language or the default application language (depending on your config file).

The function have to be called in the prefix of any route that should be translated (see Filters sections for further information).

### Get Supported Languages

```php
	/**
	 * Returns all supported languages
	 *
	 * @return array Array with all supported languages
	 */
	public function getSupportedLanguages()

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getSupportedLanguages() }}
```

This function will return all supported languages as array.

### Get Current Language Direction

```php
	/**
	 * Returns current language direction
	 *
	 * @return string current language direction
	 */
	public function getCurrentLanguageDirection()

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getCurrentLanguageDirection() }}
```

This function will return current language direction as string (ltr/rtl).


### Get Current Language Script

```php
	/**
	 * Returns current language script
	 *
	 * @return string current language script
	 */
	public function getCurrentLanguageScript()

	//Should be called in a view like this:
	{{ LaravelLocalization::getCurrentLanguageScript() }}
```

This function will return current language script as string (Latin/Cyrillic/Arabic/ ..etc).


## View

You can edit the default view for the language bar executing `php artisan view:publish mcamara/laravel-localization`.

This command will create a blade view in your app/views folder containing the default code for the language bar, edit it to style and edit your language bar that suits you the best.

## Translated Routes
_**New in version 0.5**_

You can adapt your URLs depending on the language you want to show them. For example, http://url/en/about and http://url/es/acerca (acerca is about in spanish) or http://url/en/view/5 and http://url/es/ver/5 (view == ver in spanish) would be redirected to the same controller using the proper filter and setting up the translation files as follows:
```php
	// app/routes.php

	Route::group(
	array(
		'prefix' => LaravelLocalization::setLanguage(),
		'before' => 'LaravelLocalizationRoutes' // Route translate filter
	),
	function()
	{
      /** ADD ALL LOCALIZED ROUTES INSIDE THIS GROUP **/
      Route::get('/', function()
      {
      	// This routes is useless to translate
      	return View::make('hello');
      });

      Route::get(LaravelLocalization::transRoute('routes.about'),function(){
          return View::make('about');
      });
      Route::get(LaravelLocalization::transRoute('routes.view'),function($id){
          return View::make('view',array('id'=>$id));
      });
	});

	/** OTHER PAGES THAT SHOULD NOT BE LOCALIZED **/
```
In the routes file you just have to add the `LaravelLocalizationRoutes` filter and the `LaravelLocalization::transRoute` function to every route you want to translate using the translation key.

_Tip:_ If you want to use this filter with other filters (like `LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter`) you just have to join them in the Laravel way, using | (eg: `'before' => 'LaravelLocalizationRoutes|LaravelLocalizationRedirectFilter'` )

Then you have to create the translation files and add there every key you want to translate. I suggest you to create a routes.php file inside your app/lang/language_abbreviation folder. For the previous example, I have created two translations files, these two files would look like:
```php
	// app/lang/en/routes.php
    return array(
      "about" 		=> 	"about",
      "view" 		=> 	"view/{id}", //we add a route parameter
      // other translated routes
	);
```
```php
	// app/lang/es/routes.php
    return array(
      "about" 		=> 	"acerca",
      "view" 		=> 	"ver/{id}", //we add a route parameter
      // other translated routes
	);
```

Once files are saved, you can access to http://url/en/about , http://url/es/acerca , http://url/en/view/5 and http://url/es/ver/5 without any problem. The getLanguageBar function would work as desired and it will translate the routes to all translated languages (don't forget to add any new route to the translation file).

## Config

By default only english and spanish are allowed but it can be changed using config.php file that is located at `app/config/packages/mcamara/laravel-localization/config.php` . If this file does not exist, use the following artisan command `php artisan config:publish mcamara/laravel-localization`  in order to create it.

This file have some interesting configuration settings (as the allowed languages or browser language detection, among others) feel free to play with it, all variables are self-explained.
